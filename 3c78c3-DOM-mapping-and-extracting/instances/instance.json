For each element, extract tag name, text content, attributes, visibility, and DOM depth. Generate a unique absolute XPath for every element and preserve parent-child hierarchy. Output valid JSON only in a single .json file named with a unique id containing a single JSON object with no explanations or formatting outside JSON.",
