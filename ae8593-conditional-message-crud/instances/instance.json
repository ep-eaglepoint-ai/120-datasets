    "problem_statement": "Build a CRUD application for managing messages with conditional visibility based on user roles. The app must feature a dashboard with three tabs: 'All Messages', 'User Messages', and 'Admin Messages'. Each tab should display messages based on the user's role: 'All Messages' shows all messages, 'User Messages' shows only messages sent by the current user, and 'Admin Messages' shows only messages sent by admins. The app must use a database to store messages and implement proper authentication and authorization. The app must be fully tested for all CRUD operations and role-based visibility.",
