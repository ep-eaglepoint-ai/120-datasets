  "problem_statement": "Create a fun React app called MoodMorph that lets users input their mood and instantly visualize it as a dynamic, animated geometric shape with colors and motion. The app must feature two pages: one for mood input and shape generation, and a gallery page to save and view all created shapes using LocalStorage. Requirements include using SVG/Canvas for animations, ensuring full test coverage for user interactions, and handling edge cases like empty inputs.",
