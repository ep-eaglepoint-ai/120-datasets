# MoodMorph - Before Implementation

This directory represents the **baseline/broken state** before implementing the MoodMorph application.

## Status: ❌ Not Implemented

No code has been written yet. This is intentional - it represents the starting point.

## Expected Behavior

When tests are run against this repository, they should **fail** because:
- No dependencies installed
- No source code exists
- No implementation of requirements

## Next Steps

See `repository_after/` for the complete, working implementation.
