  "problem_statement": "The current SongList component requires a refactor because it lacks essential functionality, proper error handling, and clean architectural design, resulting in poor user experience and maintainability risks. It does not provide a loading indicator while data is being fetched, offers no meaningful UI feedback when an error occurs, and simply logs failures to the console instead of informing the user. There is no retry mechanism, no support for refreshing the list manually, and no handling for the case where the API returns an empty array, leaving users with an unclear or blank screen. The component also lacks request cancellation, which can cause memory leaks if it unmounts during an active request. From a UX and accessibility perspective, it does not clearly communicate different states such as loading, error, or empty data, and may expose raw internal IDs directly to users. Architecturally, it directly calls axios instead of using a reusable API service layer, relies on outdated CommonJS imports, and lacks proper TypeScript typing for API responses and errors, making it tightly coupled to the current API structure and harder to evolve. These issues collectively make the component fragile, less scalable, and not production-ready, necessitating a refactor to introduce robust error handling, better user feedback, improved accessibility, and cleaner, modular architecture.",
