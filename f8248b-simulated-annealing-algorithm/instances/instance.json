    "problem_statement": "A Python implementation of the simulated annealing algorithm must be developed to approximate the global optimum of a user-defined objective function by mimicking the metallurgical annealing process. The core components require methods to generate a neighboring solution from the current state, calculate an acceptance probability for worse solutions using the Metropolis criterion based on a gradually decreasing temperature, and execute a cooling schedule that reduces the temperature over itåerations. The implementation must include a clear simulation loop and guidance for selecting critical parameters such as the initial temperature, cooling rate, and stopping condition to ensure effective convergence.",
