  "problem_statement": "Design a generic Python script that computes the total enclosed area of a polygon traced by relative directional movements starting from the origin. The script must translate a sequence of (direction, distance) commands into Cartesian vertices, then accurately calculate the polygon’s area using a robust implementation of the Shoelace Formula. Unlike simple polygons, the movement path may self-intersect, so the solution must correctly determine the absolute total area formed by all enclosed loops rather than relying on a signed net area, while remaining modular, reusable, and free of external numerical libraries",
