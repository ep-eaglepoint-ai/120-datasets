Replace character\u2011by\u2011character tokenization with re.findall(), stopword checks with frozenset membership, and all sorting with Python\u2019s built\u2011in sorted(), while caching stems and document vectors during indexing to avoid redundant computation. The engine must achieve at least 1,000 queries per second with under 10ms latency for keyword searches and under 50ms for similarity detection while maintaining accurate relevance ranking and phrase\u2011matching correctness.",
